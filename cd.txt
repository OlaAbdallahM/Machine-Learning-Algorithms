--> Load the dataset. And investigate it
--> What are the dimensions of this data?
--> How many features?
--> What is the output data type? Qualitative or quantitative?
--> Does it have nulls?
--> Does it have duplicate values?
-->Does it have outliers?
-->How many classes in the dataset
-->Correlation between features
-->Are the classes balanced? Does each
class have the same number of records/rows?
--> choose one feature and any target (make sense)
